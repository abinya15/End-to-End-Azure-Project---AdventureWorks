--- Large Files ---
It's good practice to not commit large data or report files.
Consider using Git LFS (Large File Storage) for the .pbix file if it's large.
For now, we are assuming the .pbix file is small enough to be committed.
Ignore any large local data files (keep sample data committed)
data/large_dataset.csv
